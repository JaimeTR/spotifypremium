### Installation/Update:
* Just download and run [BlockTheSpot.bat](https://raw.githack.com/mrpond/BlockTheSpot/master/BlockTheSpot.bat)  

or

* Run The following command in PowerShell:
```ps1
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrpond/BlockTheSpot/master/install.ps1' | Invoke-Expression
```

or

1. Browse to your Spotify installation folder `%APPDATA%\Spotify`
2. Download `chrome_elf.zip` from [releases](https://github.com/mrpond/BlockTheSpot/releases)
3. Unzip and replace `chrome_elf.dll` and `config.ini` 

### Uninstall:
* Just run uninstall.bat
or
* Reinstall Spotify 

### Known Issues:  
* You may face issue [#150](https://github.com/mrpond/BlockTheSpot/issues/150). Can be fixed by enabling the experimental feature when using `BlockTheSpot.bat`.    
* We support last 2 version of Spotify (latest + previous) only. Please check it before opening an issue.

### Additional Notes:  
* Remove "Upgrade" Button [#83](https://github.com/mrpond/BlockTheSpot/issues/83) and Remove "Ad Placeholder" [#150](https://github.com/mrpond/BlockTheSpot/issues/150) only works when you use any of the auto installation methods and press `y` when prompted.  
* "chrome_elf.dll" gets replaced by the Spotify installer each time it updates, hence why you'll probably need to apply the patch again when it happens
* [Spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli) users will need to reapply BlockTheSpot after applying a Spicetify patches.
* If the automatic install/uninstall scripts do not work, please contact [Nuzair46](https://github.com/Nuzair46)
